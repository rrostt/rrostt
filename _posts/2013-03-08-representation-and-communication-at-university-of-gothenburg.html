<p>Today I'm giving a <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/">Pecha Kucha</a> style presentation of our CSCW paper <a href="http://rost.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rostetal_cscw13.pdf">'Representation and Communication: Challenges in interpreting large social media datasets'</a> (Rost, M., Barkhuus, L., Cramer, H. and Brown, B.), at the University of Gothenburg during an <a href="http://www.letstudio.gu.se/news-and-events/calendar/calendar-detail/?eventId=1780820668#.UTSkDX3WZrw.twitter">event about social media research</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of Pecha Kucha is to make the presentations more focused and to the point. The format is to show 20 slides, each slide for 20 seconds. It restricts you from going on and on. It will be the first time I will do a Pecha Kucha presentation and am looking forward to it. I hope it will be as fun for the audience as I will have while giving it!</p>
<p>Find the abstract of the paper below.</p>
<pre>Online services provide a range of opportunities for
understanding human behaviour through the large aggregate
data sets that their operation collects. Yet the data sets they
collect do not unproblematically model or mirror the world
events. In this paper we use data from Foursquare, a
popular location check-in service, to argue for the
importance of analysing social media as a communicative
rather than representational system. Drawing on logs of all
Foursquare check-ins over eight weeks we highlight four
features of Foursquareâ€™s use: the relationship between
attendance and check-ins, event check-ins, commercial
incentives to check-in, and lastly humorous check-ins
These points show how large data analysis is affected by
the end user uses to which social networks are put.</pre>
