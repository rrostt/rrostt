<p>I've been playing around with H<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">ome Assistant</a> lately. I was surprised to not find a way to make external backups automatically. Most what I read recommended making snapshots and copy the snapshot over a samba mount manually. I wanted a way to directly make a backup and upload it to AWS S3. So late last night i threw an addon together. It can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rrostt/hassio-backup-s3">github here</a>.</p>
