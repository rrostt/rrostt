<p>If you're a PhD student working with things such as ubiquitous and mobile computing, statistics and inference, and formal modelling and analysis, the project I'm working in is offering internships! It's preferably over the summer, but not restricted to it.</p>
<p>The Populations project is trying to advancing the design process and underlying science of mobile applications. We do this by designing, building and studying mobile apps through large deployments, and investigate new methods and analysis tools that allow us to advance this area of research and practice. If you're interested in reading more you should <a href="ubiquitous and mobile computing, statistics and inference, and formal modelling and analysis">check out the call</a>.</p>
