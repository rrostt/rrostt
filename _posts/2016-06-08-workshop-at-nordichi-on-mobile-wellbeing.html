<p>We will organise a workshop at <a href="http://www.nordichi2016.org/">NordiCHI</a> later this year in Gothenburg, Sweden. The workshop is called <a href="http://www.datascienceforhealth.com/events/mobilewellbeing/">Mobile Wellbeing</a> and is to be focused around mental wellbeing and use and design of mobile technology. The workshop is organised by me, John Rooksby (UK), Alexandra Weilenmann (SE), Thomas Hillman (SE), Pål Dobrin (SE), and Juan Ye (UK). If you are interested in the workshop theme, consider writing a position paper and join us in Gothenburg on October 23. The deadline for position papers is August 25.</p>
<p>You should visit the <a href="http://www.datascienceforhealth.com/events/mobilewellbeing/">workshop website</a> for more information, but at the workshop we aim to discuss the following three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways do mobile technologies affect mental wellbeing?</li>
<li>How can mobile technologies be designed to support and improve mental wellbeing and to mitigate negative effects?</li>
<li>What strategies and practices can be developed for using mobile technology in ways that do not harm and instead support improvement of our wellbeing?</li>
</ul>
<p>See you in Göteborg!</p>
