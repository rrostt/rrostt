<p>I'm co-organizing an upcoming workshop for <a href="http://www.mobilehci2013.org/">MobileHCI</a> this year. It is on the topic of <a href="http://informdesign.ubiplayground.com/">"Informing Future Design via Large-Scale Research Methods and Big Data"</a>. It is loosely based on previous workshops I have co-organized on <a href="http://large.mobilelifecentre.org/">Research in the Large</a>. This year it goes beyond evaluation and instrumentation of app stores (which in my view have been a big theme for the previous workshops) and looks at how we can find new ways of incorporating large deployments as means to <em>inform</em>Â design. This means not only to iteratively improve existing systems and design ideas, but to use it in the ideation process of new ideas.</p>
<p>The deadline for the workshop submission is on May 10th and MobileHCI will be in Munich on August 27-30th. Check <a href="http://informdesign.ubiplayground.com/">workshop web site</a> for more info.</p>
