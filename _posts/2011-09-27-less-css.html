<p>Found this handy javascript library that I think can be extremely potent: <a title="LESScss" href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>. It basically gives scripting capabilities to CSS. For instance you can define a variable @color, and use that instead of using fixed values everywhere in your CSS file. This would ease when it comes to changing color schemes, for instance. But I think what will be most handy is the way it allows nested rules:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="css" light="true"]<br />
#header {<br />
	h1 {<br />
		font-size: 26px;<br />
		font-weight: bold;<br />
	}<br />
	p {<br />
		font-size: 12px;<br />
		a {<br />
			text-decoration: none;<br />
			&amp;:hover { border-width: 1px }<br />
		}<br />
	}<br />
}<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>which basically defines the css-rule for e.g. "#header p" and "#header p a:hover". This will make cleaner css-files, and will let you write less CSS making CSS more <a title="DRY" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. It comes with a lot more powerful stuff as well like inline javascript. Have a look for yourself and see how you can make use of it.</p>
<p>Fairly technical post, but I wanted to put it down in text as I found it and reacted to it.</p>
