<p>Last semester I gave a course on mobile app development using Flutter. The course was based around a series of video lectures, exercises, and supervision. Since the videos are recorded and there is not that much material on Flutter in Swedish, I decided to upload them to YouTube.</p>
<p>They are available here</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLSsYF82LK3ukqFNEhL_5Hp9mDnMhefcE4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The series of videos goes from introduction to Flutter, introduction to Dart programming, basic UI layouts, more advanced layouts, state management using StatefulWidget and Provider, and finally network communication.</p>
<p>Essentially it covers the basics of all aspects needed to build simple mobile applications.</p>
