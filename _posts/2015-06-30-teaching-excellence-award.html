<p>Last week I was awarded a <a href="http://www.softwarepopulations.com/teaching-award-for-mattias-rost/">Teaching Excellence Award</a>Â from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/scienceengineering/">college</a>. The award was given for my teaching activities within the school , including: the development of a set of tutorials given to students and staff across levels, supervising undergraduate and postgraduate students, and contributions to undergraduate courses.</p>
