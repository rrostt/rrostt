<p>Alex Gibson is a talented web and mobile developer who shares my views on HTML5, mobile web development, and responsive design. In <a href="http://miniapps.co.uk/blog/post/site-redesign-a-mobile-first-approach/">this post on his blog</a> he gives a thorough run through of how he re-designed <a href="http://miniapps.co.uk/">his web site</a>. He went <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">mobile first</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> and explains, among other things, how he setup his media queries. Furthermore, he explains how he re-orders content of the page depending on the device, using CSS. The web page is pretty simple, but serves as a nice case study of a mobile first, reponsively web designed, HTML5 site.</p>
