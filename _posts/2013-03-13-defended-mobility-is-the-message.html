<p>On Monday I finally <a title="PhD defence" href="http://rost.me/2013/02/16/phd-defence/">defended my PhD thesis</a> – <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?searchId=1&amp;pid=diva2:602247">Mobility is the Message: Experiments with Mobile Media Sharing</a>. The opponent was <a href="http://research.yahoo.com/David_Ayman_Shamma">David Ayman Shamma</a> from Yahoo! Research. He did an amazing job presenting his interpretation of my work, and we engaged in a lively discussion about the thesis. It was followed by questions from the committee, and the audience.</p>
<p>Now I've just got back to Glasgow, where I am visiting <a href="http://www.ubiplayground.com/">Matthew Chalmer's group</a> doing work in the <a title="Populations" href="http://www.softwarepopulations.com/">Populations project</a> at the University of Glasgow. I've been here since february and it's been a super exciting environment so far with great energy! I'm determined that great stuff will come out of what we are doing right now. But more on that another time...</p>
