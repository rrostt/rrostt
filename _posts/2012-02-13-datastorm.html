<p>I used to be active myself in what is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a>. This year there was a demoparty, which means a weekend of people getting together, and compete with different art productions. This particular demoparty, called <a href="http://datastorm.se/">Datastorm</a>, focuses on oldschool machines, particularly the Commodore 64 and the Amiga. The recommended way to experience these productions is on real hardware. But to make it more easy to consume, you can sometimes find them on youtube.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=58669">winning contribution by Fairlight</a>. Note that this is made running in realtime on a Commodore 64. To remind you, the C64 has a CPU of 1MHz (or 0.001GHz) and 64kb of memory (about 0.064Mb or 0.000064Gb).</p>
