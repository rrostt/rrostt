<p>Great news for people who develop web sites using new on the edge web standards. Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Google, HP, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia, and Opera have joined the W3C to launch a new web site on which up to date up-to-date and relevant information about HTML5, CSS3, and other standards of the web are presented, together with the status of their implementations for cross-browser considerations.</p>
<p>Go directly to <a href="http://www.webplatform.org">WebPlatform.org</a> to contribute knowledge, or to find (soon I guess) the most recent up to date information about web standards and their implementations. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/08/apple-facebook-google-microsoft-and-others-join-forces-to-launch-new-web-standards-resource">Click here for more details.</a></p>
