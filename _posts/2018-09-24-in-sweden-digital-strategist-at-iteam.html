<p>I have not updated this in a loooooong time. Figured I should at least add some minor updates before I write any other posts.</p>
<p>In January 28, 2017, me and my family left Glasgow and Scotland to move to Sweden. We had no plans on what to do so I did some freelance stuff. (30 years of programming has some benefits these days.) Not long after I decided to join <a href="https://iteam.se">Iteam</a> as a digital strategist. It meant I left academia for industry. I no longer do research, but instead help companies and organisations think in digital terms – what change does digital mean to existing business and practices. My long stretch in looking into the future by applying research through design, now benefits my ability to help seeing opportunities and what is possible for existing businesses and organisations as well as new enterprise. My long experience in building stuff indeed comes in handy at times, where I mentor more junior colleagues and help strengthen our technology skills.</p>
<p>I now live in Veddige, close to Varberg, south of Gothenburg, on the Swedish west coast. Feel free to give me a shout if you want to meet up!</p>
