<p>Once a year I'm teaching a course called Design &amp; AI. During this time I get to play around a little bit more with machine learning. As this technology is becoming increasingly available to people, I find it important for people to understand what's going on inside them. Much of it seems complicated when presented in abstract terms, but when looking at it in practical terms through using modern tools it is not as complicated as one may think.</p>
<p>After being asked by colleagues what is involved in implementing and training neural networks, I gave a seminar on the topic this week called <em>Doing Neural Networks</em>. I forgot to record the actual seminar but made a video with the same content afterwards as people asked for it. So, feel free to watch the video below where I explain what neural networks are through code.</p>
