<p>On friday I gave a guest lecture in a course at <a href="http://www.lincs.gu.se/">LinCS</a> at the <a href="http://www.gu.se/english">University of Gothenburg</a>. The course was <a href="http://www.lincs.gu.se/dses/courses/understanding-and-designing-for-social-media-practices/">'Understanding and designing for social media practices'</a>Â and is aimed at exploring methods for studying online social media.</p>
<p>The lecture was based on two previous studies of foursquare. The <a href="http://rost.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/crameretal4sqmobilehci-camerareadyfinal1.pdf">first one</a> was a primarily interview based study where we looked at performative aspects of using foursquare. The second one deals with a <a href="http://rost.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rostetal_cscw13.pdf">study of log data from foursquare</a>. The talk discussed what it means for people to share their location through the means of checking in (or what it means to check in), and discussed what this means for the genera of data, and showed examples of communicative features in the log data from foursquare.</p>
<p>The slides can be found on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rrostt/studying-foursquare">slideshare</a>.</p>
