<p><a title="Slideshare HTML5" href="http://blog.slideshare.net/2011/09/27/slideshare-html5/">SlideShare just ditched flash for HTML5.</a> This is of course awesome for the sake of HTML5, but it is also awesome for the people using it. This means that it will work everywhere where there is a browser capable of HTML5 (i.e. any modern browser including mobile ones). Unfortunately they did not go <a title="Responsive Design" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> on this one, but have separate versions depending on the device (so far I've seen a desktop version and a mobile version, and the mobile version seems to be adapting to the screen size.) They explain the benefit of having a mobile web app instead of going native for mobile in their own words</p>
<blockquote><p>If you send someone a link to a presentation and they have to download an app to view it, that’s not a pleasant user experience. We want presentations on mobile devices to be accessible to as many users as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another step away from native apps, and a step into the world of web apps.</p>
