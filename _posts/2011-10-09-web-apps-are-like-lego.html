<p>Just read another example on howÂ <a title="Web Apps Like Lego" href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/10/05/mozillas-developer-evangelist-on-why-web-apps-are-just-like-lego/?awesm=tnw.to_1BAwg&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=tnw.to-other&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_content=spreadus_master">Web Apps are Like Lego</a>. Not precisely in the same way I would use such an analogy, but an interesting one none the less. Basically Christian Heilmann, evangelist at Mozilla, used it to exemplify how when you build web apps it is easier to reuse components. However he also goes as far as saying that the web app makes a less optimal experience compared to a native app, but that it is compensated by the more rapid development, and the improved reach to more devices. I disagree with that, and hail that a properly designed mobile web app can ge beyond what a native app can do. Employing responsive design for more than layout but also functionality, one can create a context aware mobile experience, and a contextualized desktop viewing experience, all through one well thought out design. So, I agree that web apps can be seen as Lego, but I also think Lego can be more powerful, and more beautiful, than badly formed clay.</p>
