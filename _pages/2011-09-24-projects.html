<p>(This is mostly old stuff and I should probably update this at some point)</p>
<p>I have been involved in a large number of projects in which we have built various applications and services. I've gone through the route of Symbian S60 and UIQ, Windows CE/Mobile, JavaME, Android, iOS, and the web. My work has involved both designing, building, and studying, including graphical design work and user studies. I've been working in the Mobile 2.0 project at <a href="http://www.mobilelifecentre.org">Mobile Life</a> spanning several smaller sub projects. You can read more about the project at <a href="http://mobile-20.blogspot.com">mobile-20.blogspot.com</a>. Below you can read about a small selection of projects.</p>
<p><del>Most currently I'm involved in</del> the <a href="http://www.softwarepopulations.com/">Populations project</a> where we investigate new approaches to software structures, which involves building and studying use of software, studying development and the design process of software, as well applying statistical analysis and data visualization to usage logs.</p>
<h2>Research In The Large</h2>
<p>For the last couple of years I have been co-organizing workshops within the field of what we call <em>Research In The Large.</em> We also edited a Special Issue on Research in the Large for <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/journal/international-journal-mobile-human-computer/1126">International Journal of Mobile HCI</a>. At <a href="http://ubicomp2010.org/">UbiComp 2010</a> we had the first <a href="http://large.mobilelifecentre.org/2010">Research in the Large workshop</a>, followed up the year after at <a href="http://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2011/">UbiComp 2011</a> with the <a href="http://large.mobilelifecentre.org/2011">Second Workshop on Research in the Large</a>. In between I was also co-organizing the workshop <a href="http://ethics.ubiplayground.com/">Ethics, Logs, and Videotape</a>, at <a href="http://chi2011.org/">CHI 2011</a>. The third RITL workshop was held at Mobile HCI 2012. These workshops have gathered an international community interested in the opportunities of using mass distribution channels for research, challenges with getting data and research methodology, among other things. Within Research in the Large we are also interested in how we can use large datasets of usage data from services, such as check-in data from <a href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>.</p>
<h2>Mobile Web Mashups</h2>
<p>I have developed a series of web app experiments throughout the years. Most of them are technology experiments, some are more full featured apps released to the wild. They all in common that they connect existing services to other services or new functionality, and they experiment with new capabilities of HTML5 within a mobile context, e.g. the geolocation API.</p>
<p>Some more recent notable ones are described below.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Spotisquare" href="http://www.spotisquare.com">Spotisquare</a></strong> is a mobile mashup of<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-66 alignright" title="spotisquare_full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/09/spotisquare_full-300x117.png" alt="" width="180" height="70" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">  <a href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>. It lets users connect spotify playlists to foursquare venues which are discovered as you check in to those venues. You can try it out at <a href="http://m.spotisquare.com">m.spotisquare.com</a>. Spotisquare was created by me, Henriette Cramer, and Nicolas Belloni.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 24px; text-transform: none;"><strong><a href="http://rost.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/buzzy.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-67 alignright" title="buzzy" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011/09/buzzy-300x123.png" alt="" width="180" height="74" /></a>Buzzy.</strong> During the conference <a href="http://www.mobilehci2011.org">MobileHCI 2011</a> me and Alexandra Weilenmann cooked together an interactive conference schedule called <a href="http://www.mobilehci2011.org/buzzy">Buzzy</a>. As social buzz chairs we envisioned a simple (mobile) web app that gave the conference participants the ability to interact with the conference program in a collected way, rather than separately on e.g. Twitter and Facebook. Buzzy is fully responsive and work on all modern web browsers, including mobile terminals such as Android and iOS.</span></p>
